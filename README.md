<h3>How to play</h3>
<article>
The computer generates a random 4 color secret code. You need to crack this code! <br/><br/>
You get 8 turns to complete the job. Start at the bottom row. Pick a color and choose a position on the active row. When you are satisfied with your choices click the "check" button. On the left of your guess the computer will give you feedback with black and white pins which mean the following: <br/>
<b>* Black pin:</b> one of your four guesses is in the secret code and on the correct position. <br/>
<b>* White pin:</b> one of your four guesses is in the secret code but <i>not</i> on the correct position. <br/></br>
Play the fame a few times and it will all be clear.
